# Go Dev Map

Add developers location to a map

- This is a simple project designed to learn [ReactJS](https://nodejs.org).
- It's also a challenge proposed by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br) on their [Bootcamp](https://rocketseat.com.br/bootcamp).
- Use this project for **studying only** as it is not ready for production.

## The Challenge

Create a React structure using ESLint, Prettier, and EditorConfig. Use the library React Map GL where a user can click on a map, insert a github username and the app will locate the name and avatar for that user.

You can read the complete challenge description (as well as chekout the teacher's code) [here](https://github.com/Rocketseat/bootcamp-reactjs-desafio-03) (pt-br)

## Ideas TODO:

- Focus github user input when modal is opened
- Allow user to move the dev's location
